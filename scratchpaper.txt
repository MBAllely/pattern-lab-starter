alright alright alright alright

MAKE SOME MOLECULES

and an organism or something

looks a lot like React

So we're gonna need to apply the styles from Phantom HTML5 whatever and the images from it

We should be able to dynamically render this stuff, but let's work on getting it to render at all first

TASK LIST:

- successfully import styles
- render images
- apply pattern lab styles


OK WELL HANG ON WHAT DO EACH OF THESE THINGS DO

  Well, it looks like the Phantom stuff is only providing us with a stylesheet
  And the images are just images.  Duh.

  Pattern lab is a P2 thing that uses Atomic design?  Is Atomic Design a principle or a framework or a library or what

  (researches)

  OK SO Pattern Lab is "a static site generator powered by PHP that stitches UI components together."  So it's like Jekyll, but bigger?  And for PHP/node instead of Ruby.  K.

  Looks like 'atoms', 'molecules', 'organisms' et al are just synonyms for components.  That's kinda handy.


So we've got the stylesheet at scss/main.scss, and the images at images/phantom/
